# Neighborhood Map
My challenge was to make Neighborhood Map App. I did it for my favorite place - Yosemite Falls. It is a responsive web-based application that loads the full-screen map (Google Map API) with search bar functionality and the list view (Wikipedia API). I added some functionality to Wikipedia API.

I've used the [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) framework as required.

## index.html & style.css
Simple HTML and CSS code to support App's UI.

## app.js
- included and managed Google Map API to prepare the map view markers
- included Wikipedia API; loads locations, coordinates, images and titles for the selected location
- handled the event click
- In View Model created 3 observables; titles, search and filtered locations
- toggle menu code
